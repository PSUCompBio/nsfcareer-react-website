                                We are asking you to be in this research because we want to understand more about head
                                acceleration events in sports and more broadly how engineering might improve safety for players.
                                This research is being done to find out if the combination of sports sensors and modeling can help us
                                understand head acceleration events better.
                                This study may enroll up to 500 athletes and non-athletes.
                                The data obtained from this study could provide potentially useful information for the quantitative
                                diagnosis of brain injury. However, this technology can make no formal diagnosis at this time and does
                                not claim to be a diagnostic tool. Subjects are directed to a medical professional for a formal diagnosis
                                of injury.

                                In this research subjects will be asked to wear the impact sensors. The impact sensors monitor/record every
                                significant incidence of head impact (single or multiple impacts) sustained during the game or practice. They
                                measure the magnitude (both linear and rotational acceleration), location, direction and duration as well as
                                the exact time of each impact. Subjects may also be asked to get an MRI scan at the beginning of season and
                                after the subject experienced concussion. Also note the following items:
